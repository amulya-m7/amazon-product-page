        <p class="book-content">
          Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean
          dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, online predators,
          the possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland,
          and countless other threats to their nine lives.

          For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood
          at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping to prepare our
          nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread having
          with their pets.

        <p class="book-content">
          in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety
          answers crucial questions such as, “What is the right age to talk to
          my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits
          of my cat living a lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does
          my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he just play with yarn like
          cats used to do?”
